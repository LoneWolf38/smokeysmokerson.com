# About Me

Hi there, My name is Debabrata Choudhury. I am a professional software engineer currently working @ Acceldata Inc as a Senior Platform Engineer. My current interests are working with network protocols, implementing them and see how everything works in a TCP connection.
I also love learning about the low level details of the working of a computer.

I have done my BTech from IIIT(International Institute of Information and Technology), Bhubaneswar. I graduated in the year 2020. Yes you read correct, during Covid, hell of a time.
